Building
========

A simple './configure && make' should build the referencer executable, if the dependencies are present.

The build dependencies are:
	g++
	poppler-glib
	gtkmm-2.4
	libgnomeuimm-2.6 
	gnome-vfsmm-2.6
	libglademm-2.4
	gconfmm-2.6
	boost_regex
	intltool

On Ubuntu 6.10 (or 6.04 LTS), all of these may be obtained by running the following command:
	sudo apt-get install build-essential libpoppler-glib-dev libgtkmm-2.4-dev libgnomeuimm-2.6-dev libgnome-vfsmm-2.6-dev libglademm-2.4-dev libgconfmm-2.6-dev libboost-regex-dev intltool
	
(note that libboost-regex-dev is in the 'universe' repository, which is not enabled in a default Ubuntu install.  See https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/extra-repositories.html)

On Fedora Core 5, you will need to do:
	yum install gtkmm24-devel libgnomeuimm26-devel gnome-vfsmm26-devel libglademm24-devel gconfmm26-devel poppler-devel gcc-c++ boost-devel



Installing
==========

Referencer may be run in-place from the build directory (type src/referencer) for convenient evaluation or testing.  Alternatively, it maybe installed systemwide: running 'make install' should install Referencer into the /usr/local prefix by default, use "--prefix /somewhere" when running ./configure to install it elsewhere.
