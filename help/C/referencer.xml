    <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>
      &app; is a tool to help you manage your collection of documents, and to use them to generate a bibliography. It is designed with the scientist/researcher in mind, and "document" may be taken to mean "paper" in general, although &app; can deal with any kind of document that BibTeX can.

<!-- Use the Getting Started section to describe the steps required
     to start the application and to describe the user interface components

     for readers to know before they start using the application, you should
     also include this information here.
     If the information about how to get started is very short, you can

  <sect1 id="usage">
      <title>Usage</title>  
   
   <para>At it's most basic, &app; may be used for editing your documents and bibliography data (library). However, it also includes useful time-saving features. Chief amongst these is the automatic acquisition of bibliographic information (metadata) for some kinds of document.</para>
  
  <para>When you add a PDF file to your &app; library, it will automatically be searched for key identifiers such as a DOI code or arXiv identifier. If either of these is found, &app; uses your internet connection to retrieve the metadata for the document.</para>
  
  <note>If you've got a collection of already-downloaded PDFs of papers, this can save you a lot of typing!</note>
  
  <para>&app; also uses its knowledge of papers to provide handy functions such as opening the web page associated with the article, or opening the document itself. Additionally, you can attach tags to documents to catgorise them, and then browse documents more easily by filtering them by tag.</para>
  
  <para>&app; is intended to be extremely user-friendly, but to help you get up and running as smoothly as possible, the following subsections explain how to use &app;.</para>
  
  
  
  <sect2 id="howto-bibtex">
      <title>To use &app; with BibTex</title> 
      <para>&app; maintains its own library of your documents, rather than loading and editing a BibTeX file. As such, when you're ready to use your library in your LaTeX document, you can have &app; generate a BibTeX file (by choosing <menuchoice><guisubmenu>Library</guisubmenu>
              <guimenuitem>Export to BibTex</guimenuitem></menuchoice>). By default this will include all documents in your library: if you would rather only export some documents then you can use the <guilabel>Selection:</guilabel> field in the export dialog to restrict the export to certain documents. Rather than repeatedly exporting when you make changes, you can tell &app; to write the BibTeX file every time you change your library (<menuchoice><guisubmenu>Library</guisubmenu>
              <guimenuitem>Manage BibTex File</guimenuitem></menuchoice>).</para>
              
              <para>&app; will automatically handle conversion of special characters (e.g. <literal>ß</literal>) to their <application>LaTex</application> equivalents (e.g. <literal>\ss</literal>). Depending on the BibTeX style you are using in your work, capitalization of text in your LaTex output may differ from that in your &app; library. This is to allow publishers to impose their own capitalization schemes. If you want text to be capitalized in your work exactly as it is in your library, then you can use the <guilabel>Protect capitalization</guilabel> option in the BibTeX export dialog.</para>
              
              <para>If you already have a BibTeX file, you can import it into &app; by choosing <menuchoice><guisubmenu>Library</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Import...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the menubar.</para>
              
              <note>Importing and then exporting a BibTex file is not guaranteed (or intended) to produce exactly the same file as went in: &app; is not a BibTeX editor!</note>
              
              <para>Information such as document filenames and tags is not included in BibTeX files. You should always use your &app; library file as the authoritative copy.</para>

              <note>When adding a folder of files, files named ".svn", "CVS", files with the extension ".bib" or ".reflib" and files with names starting "." are automatically skipped. These files can still be added individually.</note>

  <sect1 id="tagging-searching">
      <title>Tagging And Searching</title> 
      <para>Tagging allows you to categorize your documents. Unlike a traditional hierarchical directory type organisation, a tag-based system allows a document to belong to multiple overlapping categories. For instance, you might have tags called "Physics" and "Biology", and another called "Exciting papers". If these were directories, you would have to make arbitrary choices about which to put a paper into. As it is, you can just assign both "Physics" and "Exciting papers" to a document, and when you're not excited any more just remove the "Exciting papers" tag.
      </para>
	  <para>Once you've created a tag (by choosing <menuchoice><guisubmenu>Tags</guisubmenu>
              <guimenuitem>Create Tag …</guimenuitem></menuchoice>), a checkbox for the tag will appear in the bottom half of the Tag Pane (shown or hidden using <menuchoice><guisubmenu>View</guisubmenu>
              <guimenuitem>Show Tag Pane</guimenuitem></menuchoice>). Once you've selected one or more documents, you can set or unset this tag for the group by clicking the checkbox.
	  </para>
	  <para>Once you've tagged some documents, you may want to filter your view by tag. You can do this by clicking on a tag in the list in the top half of the Tag Pane. To include more tags in the view, hold <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> while clicking to select more than one tag.
	  </para>
	  <para>To complement the tagging system, a search box is provided above the document view. Entering text into the search box will cause only those documents featuring the search text to be shown. The search only considers the <guilabel>Title</guilabel>, <guilabel>Authors</guilabel> and <guilabel>Key</guilabel> fields of the documents.

      <para>Additional functionality can be added to &app; using the versatile <ulink url="http://www.python.org" type="http">Python</ulink> language. As of version 1.1, two kinds of plugin are supported: <application>Metadata fetcher</application> plugins, and <application>Document action</application> plugins. The former might be a script that looks up metadata for a DOI code in an internet database, while the latter might be something that manipulates the metadata of an existing document in some way.</para>
      
      <para>Interested developers should download the &app; source code and look in the plugins/ directory for examples and in plugins/README for a brief guide.</para>
