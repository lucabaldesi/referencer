taglist and tagger need to be in scrolledwindows
DONE need to update tagger when rename tag
	tagging and tag create/delete seems a bit buggy still
DONE need to update docicons when tagging file (time to be more efficient)
LookupDoi and Open should really handle multiple documents.

A View menu which allows hiding of tagging sidebar

Should be able to select multiple tags for ANDing instead of ORing document selection

Drag and drop to add by filename
Add by DOI
DONE Add by nothing but displayname
	In fact by nothing at all
Progressbar when adding (many or one, both can be slow)

Should write to file and then copy into place (prevent crash blanking file)

DONE Need to do bibdata XML IO

DONE Default thumbnail for unthumbnailable things
	DONE Although it relies on unknown.png in current path, should get from iconfactory
DONE Thumbnail generation
	Now do it in the background?
DONE When thumbnailing fails, save the failure so that we don't try again

DONE Fix paths like "'file:///home/jcspray/Work/MPhys%20Dissertation/Papers/Papers (Spin glass EB)/2005: Spin-Glass-Like behaviour in CoO Nanoparticles and the origin of EB in layered COO-ferromagnet structures (Gruyters).pdf" when adding folder

To support an extra entry in the bibdata, one needs to update:
	class BibData
	BibData::writeXML
	class LibraryParser::on_start/end_element
	class CrossRefParser
	DocumentProperties::DocumentProperties
	DocumentProperties::update
	DocumentProperties::save
	documentproperties.glade
