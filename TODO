Essential:
	Conversion of accented characters into LaTeX when exporting (and importing?) bibtex
	Should write to file and then copy into place (prevent crash blanking file)
	Finding glade files in installed paths


Niceties:
	LookupDoi and Open should really handle multiple documents.
	A View menu which allows hiding of tagging sidebar

Functionality wishlist:
	Should be able to select multiple tags for ANDing instead of ORing document selection
	read PS files to search for DOIs as well as reading PDFs
	Drag and drop to add by filename
	Drag and drop to make LaTeX citations
	Drag and drop to copy file
	Copy document key to clipboard
	Should complain when adding files we already have
	Thumbnail generation is done in main thread and freezes UI
	"Manage BibTeX File" as well as one-off export
	BibTeX import (and merging with metadata-less PDFs?)
	Configuration of lookup URLs
	Configuration of proxy server for non-GNOMEers
	Configuration of max_timeout in BibData::getCrossRef
	Tell user how to go back online when asking to go offline in BibData
	gconf schema
	Somehow know when to add et. al. to authors
	Table view as well as icon view
	When generating keys from authorYEAR, should get rid of LaTeX unfriendly accented characters
	Where we use ".tmp" in writing files, we should use something more unique

Bugs:
	Crash when adding unnamed?
	Tagger's scrolledwindow seems to have a shadow/border even though we ask it not to

To support an extra entry in the bibdata, one needs to update:
	class BibData
	BibData::writeXML
	class LibraryParser::on_start/end_element
	class CrossRefParser
	DocumentProperties::DocumentProperties
	DocumentProperties::update
	DocumentProperties::save
	documentproperties.glade
