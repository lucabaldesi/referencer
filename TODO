Essential:
	Conversion of accented characters into LaTeX when exporting (and importing?) bibtex
	 - we currently output stuff which needs latin1 package
  Different doc types -- books as well as articles at least
  Extra fields
  Appropriate copyright notice for abiword-stolen UC->Latex

Niceties:
	LookupDoi and Open should really handle multiple documents.
	A View menu which allows hiding of tagging sidebar

Functionality wishlist:
	Should be able to select multiple tags for ANDing instead of ORing document selection
	read PS files to search for DOIs as well as reading PDFs
	Drag and drop to make LaTeX citations
	Drag and drop to copy (download) file
	Copy document key to clipboard
	Should complain when adding files we already have
	Thumbnail generation is done in main thread and freezes UI
	"Manage BibTeX File" as well as one-off export
	BibTeX import (and merging with metadata-less PDFs?)
	Configuration of lookup URLs
	Configuration of proxy server for non-GNOMEers
	Configuration of max_timeout in BibData::getCrossRef
	gconf schema
	Somehow know when to add et. al. to authors
	Table view as well as icon view
	When generating keys from authorYEAR, should get rid of LaTeX unfriendly accented characters
	Where we use ".tmp" in writing files, we should use something more unique
	Do something with PDF-embedded metadata if there is any
	Invalid DOIs should give more informative errors than XML parse failure
	Selective bibtex output

	

Bugs:
	Tagger's scrolledwindow seems to have a shadow/border even though we ask it not to
	In TagWindow::onIconsDragData, we do get_file_info on remote URIs synchronously
		in order to support directory recursion on remote filesystems -- this is a 
		bad thing when adding stuff from really remote things like websites

To support an extra entry in the bibdata, one needs to update:
	class BibData
	BibData::writeXML
	class LibraryParser::on_start/end_element
	class CrossRefParser
	DocumentProperties::DocumentProperties
	DocumentProperties::update
	DocumentProperties::save
	documentproperties.glade
	
EndNote is also DOI aware, dx.doi.org URLs generated when importing reference from eg INSPEC
Take heart, endnote is slow and wank and easy to be better than

Competition on Science biblio export:
	EndNote
	Reference Manager
	ProCite
	RefWorks
also: Zotero
